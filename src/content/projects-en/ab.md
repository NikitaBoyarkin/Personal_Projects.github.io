title: A/B Testing Methodology Toolkit
description: Calibration-driven A/B testing methods, validated by simulation — SRM, CUPED, delta-method ratio metrics, alpha-spending boundaries, always-valid p-values (mSPRT), bootstrap CIs, HTE, multiple-comparison correction, novelty/primacy and switchback designs. Every module ships with an A/A null check and a power/coverage calibration.

  problem: "A/B testing methods are sold on asymptotic promises, but nobody checks the Type I error under the null or the power under a real effect. Naive peeking, wrong SEs for ratio metrics, and multiple testing silently break decisions."
  approach: "Each module is implemented from the primary literature and calibrated by simulation: an A/A null check for Type I error ≈ α and a power curve under a real effect. 15 topics are covered — SRM, sizing, CUPED, delta method, alpha spending (Pocock/OBF), mSPRT, sequential ratio, Bayesian A/B, bootstrap BCa, HTE, Bonferroni/BH, novelty/primacy, switchback. All wired into an end-to-end pipeline: SRM → CUPED → CTR test → per-segment ATE with BH → novelty check → report."
  result: "The numbers are checked, not assumed: the test suite asserts Type I error ≈ α for every method, ≈95% CI coverage for bootstrap, peeking control for always-valid/alpha-spending, delta-method accuracy for ratio metrics, and correctness on known-answer fixtures."

# A/B Testing Methodology Toolkit

## Business Context

An A/B testing method is only as good as its Type I error under the null and its power under a real effect. Rather than trusting asymptotic promises, each module simulates the pipeline end-to-end and reports the empirical rates.

## Modules

| Module | Method | What the demo shows |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| `srm_test.py` | Sample Ratio Mismatch (χ²) | catches bucketing/traffic bugs before any downstream test |
| `sample_size.py` | Fixed-horizon sizing | n/arm for proportions and means |
| `delta_method_ratio.py` | Ratio metrics (CTR, RPC) | correct SE for ΣY/ΣX; the naive per-unit t-test is biased |
| `cuped.py` | Variance reduction | SE shrinks by ~corr(X,Y)² using pre-period data |
| `group_sequential.py` | Alpha-spending boundaries | Pocock/OBF control Type I while naive peeking inflates it |
| `msprt_always_valid.py` | Always-valid p-values | mSPRT lets you peek and stop any time, validly |
| `sequential_ratio.py` | Sequential ratio metrics | delta-method + mSPRT for CTR under continuous monitoring |
| `sequential_ab_testing.py` | Evan Miller's sequential rule | reproduces the size table, validates Type I/power, sample savings |
| `bayesian_ab_test.py` | Analytic Bayesian A/B | Beta-Binomial / Normal-Normal, P(B>A), expected loss, ROPE |
| `bootstrap_ci.py` | Bootstrap CIs | percentile & BCa for skewed metrics |
| `heterogeneous_treatment_effects.py` | HTE by segment | interaction model reveals Simpson-paradox-like cancellation |
| `multiple_comparisons.py` | Multiple-testing correction | Bonferroni (FWER) vs Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) |
| `novelty_primacy.py` | Time-varying effects | treat×day interaction detects novelty decay / primacy growth |
| `switchback.py` | Cluster & switchback designs | cluster-robust SE; naive over-/under-rejects; carryover bias |
| `test_simulator.py` | Generic test calibration | plug any DGP + test → empirical Type I and power curve |

## End-to-end pipeline

`scripts/run_full_pipeline.py` ties the modules into one realistic flow on synthetic data: SRM check → CUPED → delta-method CTR test → per-segment ATE with BH correction → novelty check → a markdown report in `outputs/report.md`.

## Testing Philosophy

The `tests/` suite re-runs every calibration with assertions:

- Type I error ≈ α (± tolerance) for each method under its null;
- CI coverage ≈ 95% for the bootstrap;
- naive peeking inflates Type I, always-valid / alpha-spending control it;
- the naive per-unit ratio SE is inaccurate, the delta-method SE is accurate;
- correctness on known-answer fixtures (SRM splits, segment uplifts, etc.).

## Run

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
uv run pytest                 # calibration test suite
uv run python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py   # end-to-end demo → outputs/report.md
```

## Impact

- **15 calibrated modules** — from SRM to switchback, each with an A/A null check.
- **Checked numbers** — Type I ≈ α, coverage ≈ 95%, peeking controlled.
- **Unbiased ratio metrics** — delta method instead of the naive per-unit t-test.
- **Cohesive pipeline** — from SRM check to per-segment ATEs and a novelty check.
