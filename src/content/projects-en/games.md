description: "10 playable mini-games as self-contained SVGs: 7 analytics (A/B until p<0.05, funnel drop, cohort catch, SQL tokens, metric match, retention day, funnel bottleneck) + 3 arcade (snake, pong, 2048). One file = the whole game, zero-dependency, no build step. Works on phone and desktop."

impact:
  - "10 games: 7 analytics + 3 arcade, each a self-contained SVG"
  - "Analytics concepts → game mechanics: p<0.05, retention day, funnel bottleneck"
  - "Zero-dependency: HTML+CSS+JS in one file, no build or server"
  - "Phone (swipe/tap) + desktop (keyboard/mouse), 3 themes"
  - "PostHog tracking (game_selected) + CTA → contact"

caseStudy:
  problem: "Analytics concepts — p-values, retention, funnels — are abstract: a recruiter or student can't 'feel' them from text, and passive dashboards don't provide an interactive experience."
  approach: "Each game is a self-contained SVG: HTML, CSS and JS in one file, zero-dependency, no build step. Analytics games turn concepts into mechanics: A/B Test — collect data until p < 0.05; Funnel Drop — catch falling users; Cohort Catch — catch Returning, dodge Churned; SQL Query — pick the token that completes the query; Retention Day — pick the right retention day. Hub on Astro, dark/light/cyberpunk themes, PostHog tracking."
  result: "10 games work on phone (swipe/tap) and desktop (keyboard/mouse), open from a single file with no server. Analytics games are a learning tool: concept → mechanic → intuition. Portfolio sync is automatic (sync_games.py), smoke tests on Playwright."

# Browser Mini-Games — Analytics Arcade

## Business Context

Analytics concepts — p-values, retention, funnels — are abstract. Typical demos are passive dashboards. Mini-games turn concepts into mechanics: you play, and you 'feel' why p < 0.05 matters, what a retention day is, and where the funnel bottleneck sits.

## Games

| Game | Type | Mechanic |
|------|------|----------|
| 🐍 Snake | arcade | eat, grow, don't crash |
| 🏓 Pong | arcade | beat the CPU — first to 11 |
| 🔢 2048 | arcade | merge tiles to reach 2048 |
| 🧪 A/B Test | analytics | collect data until p < 0.05 |
| 🔻 Funnel Drop | analytics | catch falling users, convert |
| 📊 Cohort Catch | analytics | catch Returning, dodge Churned |
| 🧩 SQL Query | analytics | pick the token that completes the SQL |
| 🃏 Metric Match | analytics | match metric pairs in fewest moves |
| 📅 Retention Day | analytics | pick the right retention day |
| 🔍 Funnel Bottleneck | analytics | find the biggest funnel drop |

## Architecture

Each game is a **self-contained SVG**: HTML, CSS and JS in one file. One file = the whole game, zero-dependency, no build step. The hub is Astro (static), deployed to GitHub Pages. Dark/light/cyberpunk themes via `data-theme` + `localStorage`.

## Analytics & Conversion

- `game_selected` — PostHog event on game pick.
- In-game CTA → contact (Telegram deep-link), `contact_click` event.
- Portfolio sync: `sync_games.py` copies `dist/` → `public/games/` (drift check via `--check`).

## Testing

Playwright smoke tests (pytest): each game loads from `public/` and is checked for functionality.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # dev server
npm run build        # production build → dist/
python3 sync_games.py --dry-run   # preview sync to portfolio
```

## Impact

- **10 games, 7 analytics** — concepts → mechanics → intuition.
- **Zero-dependency** — one file = the whole game, no build or server.
- **Phone + desktop** — swipe/tap and keyboard/mouse, 3 themes.
- **Tracking & conversion** — `game_selected` + CTA → contact.
