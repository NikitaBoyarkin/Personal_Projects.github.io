 *     `tests/lib/brand.test.ts` parses those token blocks and fails if any of

 *   - the OG banner generators under `scripts/`, which import this module
 *     directly so a banner can never be the only place a brand hex lives.
 *
 * The brand has two contextual accents on purpose (see DESIGN.md, "Double
 * regime"): a high-chroma orange for the royal-blue marketing surface, and a
 * coral for the site's teal canvas. They are not interchangeable — orange on
 * teal or coral on blue would each fall short of the brand's contrast targets.
