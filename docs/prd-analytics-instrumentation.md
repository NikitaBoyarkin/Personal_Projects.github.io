# PRD — Analytics Instrumentation (PostHog Data Collection)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | Draft — ready for execution |
| Date | 2026-09-19 |
| Owner | Nikita Boyarkin |
| Scope | PostHog data collection only: main site (`src/**`) + static games arcade (`public/games/**`) + PostHog project settings/artifacts. No visual redesign, no content rewrite, no new product surface. |
| Relates to | `docs/prd-v6.md` (signal consolidation), `docs/analytics-review.md` (weekly review ritual), `docs/cta-inventory.md` (CTA→event inventory). This PRD supersedes none of them; it reconciles their stale parts. |
| Trigger | Explicit request: "improve data collection with PostHog" — the funnel that must be measurable (visit → project/case study → CV → contact) is only partially instrumented. |
| Deliverable | This document, then phased code + PostHog changes with mechanical acceptance checks. |

---

## 0. How to read this document

This is an **execution PRD**. Its job is to turn the instrumentation decisions taken on 2026-09-19 into
work with verifiable acceptance criteria.

Four rules apply:

1. **Evidence classes are marked.** `[V]` verified by direct read of a file or a live PostHog query ·
   `[I]` inferred from verified evidence · `[NV]` not verified. Never upgrade `[I]` to `[V]` in a report.
2. **Every task carries an acceptance criterion that fails when the task is not done.** If a task
   cannot be checked mechanically, it says so explicitly.
3. **Existing event names are frozen.** Historical PostHog data and the saved insights listed in §1.4
   depend on them. This PRD adds and canonicalizes; it does not rename anything that already has data.
   The only exceptions are events that provably never fire (§2.1, §4.4).
4. **Collection, not reporting.** The output is trustworthy data plus a reconciled set of saved
   artifacts. New product features (flag-gated experiments, surveys) are out of scope (§11).

### Precondition — capture the baseline first

**Task A0.1 must run before any other task.** Without a baseline snapshot of the current events and
funnel conversion, none of the goals in §3 can be evaluated and no change can be attributed.

---

## 1. Context

### 1.1 Current state — main site `[V]`

PostHog is loaded as a bundled `posthog-js` module (not the CDN snippet) from
`src/components/Analytics.astro`, mounted in `<head>` via `src/layouts/Base.astro:180`.
The whole component is inert when `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is unset (`Analytics.astro:20`).

Init config, verbatim (`Analytics.astro:32-39`):

```js
posthog.init(import.meta.env.PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
  api_host: import.meta.env.PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST || 'https://us.i.posthog.com',
  defaults: '2026-05-30',
  capture_pageview: true,
  capture_pageleave: true,
  autocapture: true,
  session_recording: { maskAllInputs: true },
});
```

Local development is guarded (`Analytics.astro:27-29`): requests from `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` /
`::1` / `0.0.0.0` never init. `window.posthog` is assigned manually at `Analytics.astro:44` because a
module import does not set the global; components other than `Analytics.astro` depend on it.

Project token and host come from build-time env: `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`
(`.env.example:5-9`); in CI they are repo secrets (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml:44-47`).

### 1.2 Current state — games arcade `[V]`

`public/games/` is served verbatim (not processed by Astro). Each of 10 SVG games plus the hub
(`public/games/index.html`) embeds its own inline copy of the PostHog CDN loader, with the production
token **hardcoded in 11 files**. The games init omits `defaults` and `session_recording`:

```js
window.posthog.init(PH_KEY, {
  api_host: PH_HOST,
  capture_pageview: true,
  capture_pageleave: true,
  autocapture: true,
});
```

Note on severity `[V]`: PostHog masks session-replay inputs by default
(<https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/privacy> — "As any input element is highly likely to contain
sensitive text, we mask these by default"). The games config is therefore a **parity and hygiene**
problem, not a live privacy breach. It stays in scope at low priority.

### 1.3 Current state — PostHog project `[V]`

Live query of `system.information_schema` / event schema on 2026-09-19:

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Project | `451732` (org `NBxHive`), host `us.posthog.com` |
| Products enabled | session replay, heatmaps |
| Error tracking | **not enabled** — no `$exception` events in the schema |
| `$web_vitals` | flowing (LCP/INP/CLS/FCP spread across events) |
| `$rageclick` | observed |
| Auto-captured attribution | `utm_source`/`utm_medium`/`utm_campaign` captured on `$pageview` (`analytics-review.md:31`) |
| Deploy isolation | deploy runs only `if: github.event_name == 'push'` (`deploy.yml:53,88`) — PR/preview traffic never reaches production, so no preview pollution problem exists `[V]` |

### 1.4 Current state — saved artifacts `[V]`

Dashboards:

| id | Name | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `1994322` | Рекрутер | 3 tiles: Откуда пришли / Топ страниц / Funnel рекрутер→контакт |
| `2024833` | Портфолио — аналитика | pageviews, top projects/posts, theme_change, lang_switched |
| `1660826` | My App Dashboard | auto-generated starter; not portfolio-specific |

Funnels and key insights:

| id | short_id | Name |
|---|---|---|
| `11919159` | `j35OMv7Z` | Portfolio funnel: Visit → Project → Contact |
| `11015002` | `zlXsA98W` | Funnel: рекрутер → контакт |
| `11498265` | `nh91WEuw` | GitHub profile → portfolio: pageviews by section (utm_campaign) |
| `11015004` | `paamYLb5` | Откуда пришли |
| `11444467` | `RuErUFto` | Top posts — post_read |
| `11444441` | `jCtk3Yl7` | Top projects — project_viewed |
| `11272834` | `QPtsvkv1` | Portfolio Funnel: Shuffle → View → Read → Theme (tutorial artifact) |

### 1.5 What is actually emitted today `[V]`

Explicit `posthog.capture()` calls:

| Event | Properties | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `project_viewed` | `{slug, locale}` | `Analytics.astro:61` |
| `post_read` | `{slug, locale}` | `Analytics.astro:68` |
| `${page}_viewed` → `whois_viewed` / `value_viewed` / `work-with-me_viewed` | `{locale}` | `Analytics.astro:76` |
| `case_study_read` | `{slug, locale}` at ≥75% scroll | `Analytics.astro:97` |
| `lang_switched` | `{from, to, path}` | `Analytics.astro:115` |
| `<data-analytics value>` (delegated) | `{path}` | `Analytics.astro:124` |
| `theme_change` | `{theme}` | `Base.astro:276` |
| `ask_me_used` | `{question, answer_matched, locale}` | `AskMe.astro:187` |
| `random_post_click` | `{slug, path}` | `BlogFilter.astro:262` |

Delegated `data-analytics` names (~30 static + 7 dynamic templates) are catalogued in
`docs/cta-inventory.md`; dynamic ones embed the slug in the event name
(`project_view_<slug>`, `project_github_<slug>`, `headline_case_<slug>`, `more_project_<slug>`).

Games emit `game_started`, `game_over`, `game_win`, `daily_completed`, `best_broken`,
`sig_reached`, `experiment_started`, `milestone`, `game_selected`, `contact_click` (`[V]`, per SVG).

---

## 2. Problem statements

### P1 — Events that provably never fire `[V]`

`Analytics.astro:74-79` emits `whois_viewed` / `value_viewed` / `work-with-me_viewed` for routes
that now **308-redirect to `/about/#…`** (`astro.config.mjs:22-32`). The event names, however, still
appear in the live PostHog schema from before the redirects — so they read as "tracked" while
collecting nothing now. `HomeBoard.astro` carries `telegram_board` / `github_board` /
`linkedin_board`, but the component is **imported by no page**, so those never fire either.

### P2 — No single source of truth for events `[V]`

Event names are string literals spread across ~15 files, half of them via `data-analytics`
attributes, with no type, no schema and no shared definition. Nothing fails at build time when a name
is misspelled, and a new event can silently diverge from the ones around it.

### P3 — Silent no-op failure mode `[V]`

`theme_change`, `ask_me_used` and `random_post_click` read `window.posthog`, which is only assigned
inside the `if (!IS_LOCAL)` block at `Analytics.astro:44`. If the block is skipped (no key, localhost),
every one of those calls silently does nothing. There is no alarm anywhere.

### P4 — The hiring funnel has holes `[I]`, grounded in §1.5

- **Attribution is coarse.** PostHog captures referring domain and UTM natively, but there is no
  normalized first-touch class (`linkedin` / `github` / `google` / `direct` / `other`), and the review
  doc (`analytics-review.md:27-31`) treats referrers as a manual reading exercise.
- **Audience selector is invisible.** The home audience selector writes `localStorage['audience']`
  and `data-audience` (`Base.astro:165-177`) but emits **no event** — segmentation data exists in the
  DOM and is thrown away.
- **Section views on `/about` are invisible.** The personal-layer content now lives as anchors
  (`#whois`, `#work-with-me`, `#now`); nothing records which section a visitor actually reached —
  the very signal the dead `*_viewed` events were meant to carry.
- **Outbound clicks are not distinguished.** Autocapture catches clicks, but there is no explicit
  `outbound_click` with a normalized `domain`, so "which external destination did they leave for"
  is not directly queryable.

### P5 — Content engagement is measured only for case studies `[V]`

`scroll-depth.ts` measures one thing: 75% on a case study (`CASE_STUDY_READ_DEPTH = 0.75`).
Posts, notes and topic pages have no depth signal at all. Site search emits `search_open` but never
what was searched or whether it returned anything. `BlogFilter.astro` emits `random_post_click` but
not which filter was applied.

### P6 — Documentation is ahead of the code `[V]`

`docs/cta-inventory.md:9,35,48` and `docs/prd-v4.md:56` describe `hero_cta_click` /
`hero_cta_exposure`. Neither exists in code (the A/B was removed; `docs/analytics-review.md:37`
confirms the flag was deactivated 2026-09-15). `analytics-review.md:45-49` lists `linkedin_hero`,
`github_hero`, `telegram_header` — the first two are gone and the third never existed. A reviewer
following the docs is measuring events that do not exist.

### P7 — No client-side error visibility `[V]`

Error tracking is off at the project level and `capture_exceptions` is not set in code, so rendering
errors on the static site are invisible. Two orphan events are present in the live schema with no
source in the repo — `eng_analytics_test_census` and `analysis_completed` `[V]`; see §13.

---

## 3. Goals and non-goals

### 3.1 Goals

| # | Goal | Measured by |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | One typed source of truth for events | `src/lib/analytics.ts` exists; `bun run check` passes with no untyped capture calls left (§5.1) |
| G2 | Zero silent no-op captures | code has no bare `window.posthog.capture` outside the module (§5.2) |
| G3 | The hiring funnel is fully instrumented | funnel `visit → project/case study → CV → contact` breakable down by `audience` and `initial_referrer_class` in one saved insight (§5.7) |
| G4 | Content engagement is measurable per content type | `read_depth` present for posts and case studies; `search_used` / `filter_applied` present (§5.8–5.10) |
| G5 | Client errors are captured | `$exception` events visible in PostHog within 24h of deploy (§5.11) |
| G6 | Games and site collect under the same rules | games init matches site init; token has one source (§5.12) |
| G7 | Dead code and stale docs are gone | no `*_viewed` for redirected routes; `cta-inventory.md` / `analytics-review.md` contain no event absent from code (§5.5, §5.15) |
| G8 | Saved artifacts reflect reality | dashboards/funnels in §1.4 reference only live events and carry the new breakdowns (§5.13) |

### 3.2 Non-goals

- No redesign, no content rewrite, no new page or UI surface.
- No cookie banner, no consent-management platform, no `cookieless_mode` (see §11 for rationale).
- No `identify()` / person-level identity (see §11).
- No new experiments, feature flags, surveys or cohorts.
- No changes to `monitoring/**` (Prometheus/Grafana exporter) or `BeaconMetrics.astro`.

## 4. Event taxonomy (canonical)

### 4.1 Naming rules

`object_action`, `snake_case`. No identifier in the event name — the entity goes in a property
(this is what retires `project_view_<slug>`). Properties are `snake_case` and typed.

### 4.2 Super properties (registered once, attached to every event)

| Property | Source | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `locale` | path (`/en/…`) | `ru` \| `en` |
| `audience` | `localStorage['audience']` | `recruiter` \| `peer` \| `curious` \| `null` |
| `theme` | `localStorage` / `data-theme` | `dark` \| `light` \| `cyberpunk` |
| `prefers_reduced_motion` | `matchMedia` | boolean |
| `initial_referrer_class` | first-touch, normalized | `linkedin` \| `github` \| `google` \| `direct` \| `other` |
| `landing_path` | first-touch pathname | string |

`posthog.register()` registers these and persists them. `initial_utm_*` is **not** re-implemented —
PostHog already captures UTM on `$pageview` (`analytics-review.md:31`) `[V]`. The genuine additions
are the normalized `initial_referrer_class` and the first-touch `landing_path`.

### 4.3 Events — preserved unchanged

`$pageview`, `$pageleave`, `$web_vitals`, `$autocapture`, `$rageclick`, `$dead_click` (SDK);
`project_viewed`, `post_read`, `lang_switched`, `theme_change`, `ask_me_used`, `random_post_click`;
all existing `data-analytics` names catalogued in `cta-inventory.md`; all game events in §1.2.

### 4.4 Events — new

| Event | Properties | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `audience_selected` | `{audience, path}` | visitor picks an audience (site + any future surface) |
| `section_viewed` | `{section, path}` | `/about` anchor section (`whois`, `work-with-me`, `now`) enters viewport 50% (IntersectionObserver, once per section per load) |
| `outbound_click` | `{domain, url, surface, path}` | click on a link leaving the site (`domain` = hostname, not full URL where avoidable) |
| `search_used` | `{query, results_count, locale}` | search submitted with ≥1 result |
| `search_no_results` | `{query, results_count: 0, locale}` | search submitted with 0 results |
| `read_depth` | `{content_type, slug, depth, locale}` | `content_type ∈ {post, case_study, note}`, `depth ∈ {25, 50, 75, 100}`, at most one event per threshold per page load |
| `filter_applied` | `{tag, results_count, surface}` | writing/notes tag filter applied (`surface ∈ {writing, notes}`) |

### 4.5 Events — canonicalized (old name stops, history stays)

| Retired emission | Canonical replacement | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `project_view_<slug>` (`ProjectCard.astro:56`) | `project_viewed {slug, surface}` | slug belongs in a property, not the name |
| `case_study_read` (`Analytics.astro:97`) | `read_depth {content_type:'case_study', depth:75}` | one depth signal for all content types |

Historical `project_view_<slug>` and `case_study_read` data remains in PostHog and must not be deleted.

### 4.6 Events — removed (provably dead)

| Event | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `whois_viewed`, `value_viewed`, `work-with-me_viewed` | `Analytics.astro:74-79` | routes 308-redirect to `/about` |
| `telegram_board`, `github_board`, `linkedin_board` | `HomeBoard.astro` | component is imported by no page |

`hero_cta_click` / `hero_cta_exposure` are removed from **docs** only — already absent from code.

---

## 5. Requirements

Every requirement below is verifiable. `§6` turns them into phased tasks.

### 5.1 REQ-A01 — Central typed analytics module

New `src/lib/analytics.ts` exports a typed event map, a `track()` function, and a super-properties
registrar. All site instrumentation goes through it.

**Acceptance:** `src/lib/analytics.ts` exists; `bun run check` passes; `rg "posthog\.capture" src/`
returns matches only inside `src/lib/analytics.ts` and `src/components/Analytics.astro`.

### 5.2 REQ-A02 — No silent no-op

`track()` is a no-op **only** when PostHog was never initialised, and in that case it warns once in
dev (`import.meta.env.DEV`). Components must not read `window.posthog` directly.

**Acceptance:** `rg "window\.posthog" src/` returns no matches outside `Analytics.astro`; a unit test
asserts `track()` before init does not throw and does not dispatch.

### 5.3 REQ-A03 — Super properties registered once

On init, `registerSuperProperties()` sets every property in §4.2 exactly once per session, reading
`locale`, `audience`, `theme`, `prefers_reduced_motion` from the DOM/localStorage and first-touch
attribution from `sessionStorage` (fallback `localStorage`), computed once.

**Acceptance:** unit tests cover the attribution classifier
(`linkedin.com`→`linkedin`, `github.com`→`github`, `google.*`→`google`, empty→`direct`, other→`other`)
and first-touch persistence (second call does not overwrite the stored value).

### 5.4 REQ-A04 — Taxonomy documented

New `docs/analytics-events.md` is the canonical reference: every event, its properties, its type, and
where it fires. It is generated/maintained by hand but must match `src/lib/analytics.ts`.

**Acceptance:** every name in `docs/analytics-events.md` exists in the event map and vice versa; a
reviewer can diff the two lists mechanically.

### 5.5 REQ-A05 — Dead events removed

`Analytics.astro:74-79` deleted; `HomeBoard` analytics calls removed (component file left as-is —
it may be WIP).

**Acceptance:** `rg "whois_viewed|value_viewed|work_with_me_viewed|_board'" src/` returns no matches;
after deploy, no new `*_viewed` events appear in the PostHog live schema for 7 days.

### 5.6 REQ-A06 — Project events canonicalized

`ProjectCard.astro` and `HeadlineCases.astro` emit `project_viewed {slug, surface}`; the
`project_view_<slug>` / `headline_case_<slug>` emissions stop.

**Acceptance:** `rg "project_view_" src/` matches only `project_viewed`; the existing insight
`Top projects — project_viewed` (`jCtk3Yl7`) still returns data after deploy.

### 5.7 REQ-A07 — Funnel signals added

`audience_selected`, `section_viewed`, `outbound_click` implemented per §4.4.

**Acceptance:** each event appears in PostHog Live Activity when the corresponding interaction is
performed manually on the deployed site (checklist §8); a `section_viewed` with `section:'whois'`
fires when the `/about#whois` anchor is scrolled into view.

### 5.8 REQ-A08 — Search signals added

`search_used` / `search_no_results` emit from `SearchBox.astro`.

**Acceptance:** searching a real term produces `search_used` with a non-zero `results_count`;
searching `zzzzz` produces `search_no_results`. No raw query string is longer than 100 chars (truncated).

### 5.9 REQ-A09 — Read depth generalized

`scroll-depth.ts` gains a threshold list and a generic `contentType(path)` helper; `read_depth` fires
per threshold. `case_study_read` stops being emitted.

**Acceptance:** `scroll-depth.ts` unit tests cover each threshold and each content type; a `post`
page emits `read_depth {content_type:'post'}` at 25/50/75/100; an existing case-study page emits
`read_depth {content_type:'case_study'}` at 75 (parity with the retired `case_study_read`).

### 5.10 REQ-A10 — Filter signal added

`BlogFilter.astro` emits `filter_applied {tag, results_count, surface}` when a filter is applied.

**Acceptance:** clicking a topic chip emits `filter_applied` with the chip's tag and the rendered
result count.

### 5.11 REQ-A11 — Error tracking enabled

`capture_exceptions: { capture_unhandled_errors: true, capture_unhandled_rejections: true }` added to
the site init; Error Tracking enabled in PostHog project settings.

**Acceptance:** a deliberately thrown error on a preview/manual test page produces a `$exception` in
PostHog (verified once, then reverted); the Error Tracking product shows the issue grouped.

### 5.12 REQ-A12 — Games config parity + single-source token

`public/games/*` (11 files) use a placeholder `__PH_KEY__`; a postbuild script injects
`PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` into `dist/games/*`; games init adds `defaults` and
`session_recording: { maskAllInputs: true }` to match the site.

**Acceptance:** `rg "phc_" public/games/` returns no matches; `dist/games/index.html` after
`bun run build` contains the injected key and the aligned init options; local `bun run dev` games
contain no key.

### 5.13 REQ-A13 — Artifacts reconciled

Funnels `j35OMv7Z` and `zlXsA98W` and dashboard `1994322` reference only live events and gain
`audience` / `initial_referrer_class` breakdowns where useful; `My App Dashboard` (`1660826`) deleted;
the tutorial artifact `QPtsvkv1` reviewed and removed if obsolete.

**Acceptance:** every saved insight's query references an event present in `docs/analytics-events.md`;
an alias `old_event` OR `new_event` is used where a funnel must bridge rename history
(`case_study_read` OR `read_depth`).

### 5.14 REQ-A14 — Unit tests

New `tests/lib/analytics.test.ts` (module, super-props, attribution classifier) and extended
`tests/lib/scroll-depth.test.ts`.

**Acceptance:** `bun run test` passes; coverage of `src/lib/analytics.ts` and `src/lib/scroll-depth.ts`
includes every exported function.

### 5.15 REQ-A15 — Docs reconciled

`docs/cta-inventory.md` and `docs/analytics-review.md` updated: `hero_cta_*`, `linkedin_hero`,
`github_hero`, `telegram_header` removed; new events and the new funnel breakdowns documented; the
review ritual points at the canonical events.

**Acceptance:** `rg "hero_cta_click|hero_cta_exposure|linkedin_hero|github_hero|telegram_header" docs/`
returns no matches.

## 6. Tasks

Phases are ordered; a later phase's acceptance check assumes the earlier ones passed. `A0` is a
precondition.

### Phase A0 — Baseline (precondition)

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A0.1 | Snapshot current production numbers into `docs/prd-analytics-instrumentation-baseline.md`: event counts per name (30d), funnel `j35OMv7Z` conversion, referrer mix. | File exists with a dated table; numbers reproducible from a saved PostHog query. |

### Phase A1 — Module and migration

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A1.1 | Create `src/lib/analytics.ts` (event map, `track()`, `registerSuperProperties()`, attribution classifier). | REQ-A01, REQ-A02, REQ-A03 pass. |
| A1.2 | Migrate `Analytics.astro` page-type events and the delegated-click handler to `track()`. | `rg "posthog\.capture" src/` matches only `analytics.ts` + `Analytics.astro`. |
| A1.3 | Migrate `Base.astro:276` (`theme_change`), `AskMe.astro:187`, `BlogFilter.astro:262`. | REQ-A02 passes; each still fires in Live Activity. |

### Phase A2 — New signals and canonicalization

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A2.1 | `audience_selected`, `section_viewed`, `outbound_click`. | REQ-A07 passes. |
| A2.2 | `search_used`, `search_no_results` in `SearchBox.astro`. | REQ-A08 passes. |
| A2.3 | Generalize `scroll-depth.ts`; emit `read_depth`. | REQ-A09 passes. |
| A2.4 | `filter_applied` in `BlogFilter.astro`. | REQ-A10 passes. |
| A2.5 | Canonicalize project events. | REQ-A06 passes. |

### Phase A3 — Cleanup

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A3.1 | Remove dead events (§4.6). | REQ-A05 passes. |
| A3.2 | Write `docs/analytics-events.md`. | REQ-A04 passes. |

### Phase A4 — Error tracking

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A4.1 | Add `capture_exceptions` to site init. | REQ-A11 code half. |
| A4.2 | Enable Error Tracking in PostHog project settings. | REQ-A11 product half (`$exception` observed once). |

### Phase A5 — Games

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A5.1 | Replace hardcoded token with `__PH_KEY__` in all 11 files; align init. | `rg "phc_" public/games/` empty. |
| A5.2 | Add `scripts/inject-games-analytics.mjs` and wire `postbuild` in `package.json`. | REQ-A12 passes after `bun run build`. |

### Phase A6 — PostHog artifacts

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A6.1 | Reconcile funnels and dashboard; add breakdowns. | REQ-A13 passes. |
| A6.2 | Delete `My App Dashboard`; review `QPtsvkv1`. | Dashboard list contains no auto-starter artifact. |

### Phase A7 — Tests and docs

| Task | Work | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| A7.1 | `tests/lib/analytics.test.ts`; extend `scroll-depth.test.ts`. | REQ-A14 passes; `bun run test` green. |
| A7.2 | Update `cta-inventory.md`, `analytics-review.md`. | REQ-A15 passes. |
| A7.3 | Run `bun run check` and `make check`; full pass. | Both commands exit 0. |

---

## 7. PostHog project-side changes

| Change | How | Reversible |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Error Tracking | Project settings (or MCP) | yes |
| Delete `My App Dashboard` (`1660826`) | MCP / UI | yes (recoverable) |
| Edit funnels `j35OMv7Z`, `zlXsA98W`, dashboard `1994322` | MCP / UI | yes (do not delete) |
| Review `QPtsvkv1` tutorial funnel | MCP / UI | recommend delete if unused |

Not changing: replay/heatmap product toggles (already on), `respect_dnt`, cookie persistence
(see §11), retention settings.

---

## 8. Verification checklist (post-deploy, manual)

Run once after the first deploy that contains Phases A1–A3. Each line is pass/fail.

1. Load `/` → `$pageview` with `locale`, `initial_referrer_class`, `landing_path` present.
2. Pick an audience → `audience_selected`.
3. Open `/about`, scroll to the `#whois` anchor → `section_viewed {section:'whois'}`.
4. Click an external LinkedIn/GitHub link → `outbound_click {domain}`.
5. Search a real term → `search_used {results_count>0}`; search `zzzzz` → `search_no_results`.
6. Open a post, scroll to bottom → `read_depth` at 25/50/75/100.
7. Apply a topic filter → `filter_applied {tag, results_count}`.
8. Open a project card link → `project_viewed {slug, surface}` (no `project_view_<slug>`).
9. Toggle theme → `theme_change`; switch language → `lang_switched`.
10. No new `whois_viewed` / `value_viewed` / `work-with-me_viewed` events.
11. Thrown test error → `$exception` in Error Tracking (once, then reverted).

## 9. Rollout

- Order: A0 → A1 → A2 → A3 → A4 → A5 → A6 → A7.
- Deploy gate: `bun run check`, `bun run test`, `make check`, Lighthouse CI (unchanged).
- One PR or a small series; A0's baseline file lands first so the change is attributable.
- Rollback: revert the PR. PostHog artifact edits are separately reversible; no event history is
  deleted except the artifacts named in §7.

## 10. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Canonicalizing `project_view_<slug>` breaks `Top projects` insight | medium | REQ-A06 acceptance explicitly re-queries the insight post-deploy |
| Funnel breaks across `case_study_read`→`read_depth` | medium | use `old OR new` alias in the funnel (§5.13) |
| Super-property registration runs after early events | low | register before first page-view capture; unit-tested |
| Games postbuild misses a file | low | script iterates `dist/games/*` and fails loudly if the token is absent from output |
| Silent no-op regresses | low | REQ-A02 forbids direct `window.posthog`; test asserts warning path |
| New events add noise to existing dashboards | low | new events are additive; dashboard edits are scoped in A6.1 |

## 11. Out of scope (explicit)

- **Consent banner / consent platform.** A personal portfolio; a banner harms the very conversion the
  funnel measures. Revisit only if a legal requirement appears.
- **`cookieless_mode`.** Would improve privacy but costs cross-session attribution — the funnel is
  the primary goal, so cookie persistence stays.
- **`respect_dnt`.** Deprecated signal with false positives.
- **`identify()` / person profiles.** No PII is collected on the site; anonymous + super properties is
  sufficient for segmentation.
- **`monitoring/**` and `BeaconMetrics.astro`.** Separate first-party contour, disabled by default.
- **Surveys, feature flags, experiments, cohorts.** No new product surface.
- **Server-side analytics.** Static site, no server to instrument.

## 12. Open items

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `eng_analytics_test_census` — in the live schema, no source in the repo | `[V]` unexplained; investigate during A0.1, then annotate or ignore |
| `analysis_completed` — in the live schema, no source in the repo | `[V]` unexplained; same as above |
| `hero_cta_exposure` — historical data present, code removed | `[V]` leave historical data; remove only doc references (A7.2) |
| PostHog retention window for `$ai_*` / LLM events | not relevant to this site; ignore |
